1,Suntory Toki,4(33 Reviews),"Toki is a blended whisky from Suntory's three distilleries: Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita.

92,Suntory Torys Classic,3.5(2 Reviews),"Suntory Torys Classic is a light and easy-drinking Japanese spirit. Due to being below 40% abv, this cannot be called a whisky in the EU, but is still made from a blend of malt and grain."
93,Suntory Toki,4(33 Reviews),"Toki is a blended whisky from Suntory's three distilleries: Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita.

99,Kaiyo Peated Mizunara Oak,value dont exist here,"A fruity, zesty and softly-smoky Japanese whisky, matured in mizunara oak casks. Aromas of orange peel, jasmine, soft cedar and coastal air fill the nose. The palate offers notes of earthy coffee, green apples, black tea and fresh herbs, with hints of cinnamon pastries and mango that linger in the finish."
100,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak Cask Strength,5(3 Reviews),"This is cask-strength edition of Kaiyo's Mizunara matured whisky. It's a rare beast, as there's not much Mizunara – Japanese oak – and only a tiny amount gets turned into whisky casks. It's worth the effort, as it adds a distinctly Japanese edge to the whisky, layering on incense-laden spiciness. Kaiyo go even further, shipping their casks out to sea for months before bottling to give them a gentle rock on the waves, getting even more flavour out of the wood."
